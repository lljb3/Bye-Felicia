        Description: You know Hello, Dolly? Yeah, we're switching that out. When activated you will randomly see a line from <cite>Friday</cite> in the upper right of your admin screen on every page. We also put <cite>Today Was A Good Day</cite> by Ice Cube on here. You better know which line is from what. Now, what up on that 40, homie?

        You need to borrow a job with your broke ass. Always trying to smoke up somebody’s s#!+. Get the hell on Felicia.
        I’m gonna remember that.
        Remember it. Write it down. Take a picture. I don’t give a f---!

        Bye, Felicia.
        Y’all stingy.
        Just wakin' up in the morning, gotta thank God,
        I don't know, but today seems kinda odd...
        No barking from the dog, no smog.
        And momma cooked a breakfast with no hog.
        I got my grub on, but didn't pig out.
        Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out!
        Hooked it up for later as I hit the door,
        Thinkin', “Will I live another 24?”
        I gotta go, ‘cause I got me a drop-top.
        And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop.
        Had to stop at a red light,
        Lookin' in my mirror and not a jacker in sight.
        And everything is alright!
        I got a beep from Kim, and she can f--- all night.
        Called up the homies and I'm askin' y'all,
        “Which park are y'all playin' basketball?”
        Get me on the court and I'm trouble.
        Last week, f----d around and got a triple double!
        Freakin' n---as every way, like MJ,
        I can't believe today was a good day.";
